//MAcro app notes
1. Add a create a foodType menu that users can enter in macro info to add to your array of FoodTypes that can be used later on. Make sure to update the drop down list after a new food is added to the food array.
	-Check to make sure they enter appropriate values and send an error message if not, don't let them create a shitty object.

2. Add ComponentOfMeal class that is created when the user add an item to the list 
    -The class will store the food type eaten('brocoli') and grams eaten
    -Add methods that can be called on this class to get the different macros for this CompoenentOfMeal().
